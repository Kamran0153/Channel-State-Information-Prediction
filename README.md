# Channel State Information Generation and Prediction

We consider a single downlink communication system, where a Base Station (BS) transmits information to a mobile user. The mobile user obtains samples of the channel conditions in the downlink and reports the noisy channel state information to the BS. However, due to communication errors or delay, the received channel information in the BS is not fresh. BS uses the stale and noise channel state information to predict the current channel state information. We consider a Rayleigh feading channel model. In this notebook, we will generate Rayleigh fading channel. Then, using the noisy sequence of stale channels, we will predict current channel state information.

# Dataset Generation
The Rayleigh fading process with unit variance is generated by using sum of sinusoids method described in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1512123
